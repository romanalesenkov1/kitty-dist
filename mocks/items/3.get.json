  "description": "Chloe is wonderful companion, you will always have your best friend close at hand if you live with him. Highly talkative, Chloe can always find something to chat about and it is quite common to find people having conversations with their cats.  Chloe is also very active, and like to keep himself busy, usually by being with you, helping with the dinner, chewing the broom as you sweep, and keeping your newspaper warm as you read it."
