  "description": "Bella is an affectionate intelligent cat, very people orientated, extremely active and a cat that thrives on interaction and play. She is not constant lap cat, rather, she needs to know what you are doing; like to help you make a telephone call; read your newspaper or make your bed, in fact she insist on being included in all family activities as a right. Whatever it is, Bella has to be totally involved. Bella is not always ideal for everyone so if this higher level of activity will annoy you then a quieter breed should be sort."
